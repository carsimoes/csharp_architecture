Observer design pattern includes observers (subscriber) and a Subject (Provider, Observable or Publisher). One or many 
observers can subscribe to the providers for any specific interest. When some specified condition occurs in the Subject 
object, it will send notification to all of the subscribed observers.

This pattern is also helpful in any application to send push notifications to the subscribed users.
